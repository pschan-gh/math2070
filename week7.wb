@title{Division Theorem for Polynomials with Rational Coefficients}
For all $f, g \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$, such that $f \neq 0$, there exist unique $q, r \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$,
satisfying $\deg r < \deg f$, such that $g = fq + r$.
@end
@proof
@newcol
We first prove the existence of $q$ and $r$, via induction on the degree of $g$.
The base step corresponds to the case $\deg g < \deg f$. In this case,
the choice $q = 0$, $r = g$ works, since $g = f\cdot 0 + g$,
and $\deg r = \deg g < \deg f$.

@col
Now, we establish the inductive step.
Let $f$ be fixed.
Given $g$, suppose for all $g'$ with $\deg g' < \deg g$,
there exist $q', r' \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that $g' = fq' + r'$,
with $\deg r' < \deg f$.
We want to show that there exist $q, r$ such that $g = fq + r$, with $\deg r < \deg f$.

@col
Suppose $g = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_m x^m$ and $f = b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_n x^n$,
where $a_m, b_n \neq 0$.
We may assume that $m \geq n$, since the case $m < n$ (i.e. $\deg g < \deg f$)
has already been proved.

@col
Consider the polynomial:
\[
g' = g - \frac{a_m}{b_n}x^{m - n}f.
\]
Then, $\deg g' < \deg g$,
and by the induction hypothesis we have:
\[
g' = fq' + r'
\]
for some $q', r' \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that $\deg r' < \deg f$.

@col
Hence,
\[
g - \frac{a_m}{b_n}x^{m - n}f = g' = fq' + r',
\]
which implies that:

@col
\[
g = f\left(q' + \frac{a_m}{b_n}x^{m - n}\right) + r'
\]
This establishes the existence of the quotient $q = q' + \frac{a_m}{b_n}x^{m - n}$ and the remainder $r = r'$.

@col
Now, we prove the uniqueness of $q$ and $r$.
Suppose $g = fq + r = fq' + r'$, where $q, q', r, r' \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$,
with $\deg r, \deg r' < \deg f$. We have:
\[
fq + r = fq' + r',
\]
which implies that:

@col
\[
\deg f(q - q') = \deg (r' - r) < \deg f.
\]
The above inequality can hold only if $q = q'$, which in turn implies that $r' = r$.
It follows that the quotient $q$ and the remainder $r$ are unique.

Given $f, g \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$, a @keyword{Greatest Common Divisor} $d$ of $f$ and $g$
is a polynomial in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ which satisfies the following two properties: <ol>
<li> $d$ divides both $f$ and $g$. </li>
<li> For any $e \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ which divides both $f$ and $g$, we have $\deg e \leq \deg d$. </li></ol>

@claim
@newcol
If $g = fq +r$, and $d$ is a GCD of $g$ and $f$, then $d$ is a GCD of $f$ and $r$.

@slide
@cor
The Euclidean Algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Q}[x]$.

@newcol
Namely:  Suppose $\deg g \geq \deg f$.
let $g_0 = g$, $f_0 = f$, and let $r_0$ be the unique polynomial in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$
such that:
\[
g_0 = f_0q_0 + r_0,\quad \deg r_0 < \deg f_0,
\]
for some $q_0 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$.

@col
For $k > 0$,
let:
\[
g_k = f_{k-1}, \quad f_k = r_{k - 1}.
\]
Let $r_k$ be the remainder such that:
\[
g_k = f_k q_k + r_k,
\]
for some $q_k \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$.

@col
Since $\deg r_k < \deg f_k = \deg r_{k - 1}$,
we have:
\[
\deg r_0 > \deg r_1 > \deg r_2 > \cdots \geq 0 \geq -\infty
\]
(where by convention we let $\deg 0 = -\infty$).

@col
Eventually, $r_n = 0$ for some $n$,
and it follows from the previous claim
and arguments similar to those used in the case of $\mathbb{Z}$
that $r_{n-1}$ is a GCD of $f$ and $g$.

@section{Factorization of Polynomials}
@defn
A polynomial $p$ in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is @keyword{irreducible} if it satisfies the following conditions: <ol>
<li> $\deg p > 0$, </li>
<li> if $p = ab$ for some $a, b \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$, then either $a$ or $b$
is a constant. </li></ol>
@end
<hr/>
@claim
@newcol
If $p \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ is irreducible and $p | f_1f_2$, where $f_1, f_2 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$,
then $p | f_1$ or $p | f_2$.
@endcol
@end
@proof
@newcol
Suppose $p$ does not divide $f_2$, then the only common divisors of $p$ and $f_2$ are
constant polynomials.
In particular, $1$ is a GCD of $p$ and $f_2$.  Then, by @ref{bezoutpolynomial} ,
there exist $u, v, \mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that $1 = pu + f_2v$.  We have:
\[
f_1 = puf_1 + f_1f_2v.
\]
Since $p$ divides the right-hand side of the above equation, it must divide $f_1$.
@qed

@slide
@thm
A polynomial in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ of degree greater than zero is either irreducible or a product of irreducibles.
@end
@proof
@newcol
Suppose there is a nonempty set of polynomials of degree $> 0$
which are neither irreducible nor products of irreducibles.  Let
$p$ be an element of this set which has the least degree.  Since $p$ is not irreducible,
there are $a, b \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ of degrees $> 0$ such that $p = ab$. But, $a, b$, having degrees strictly
less than $\deg p$, must be either irreducible or products of irreducibles.  This implies that $p$ is a product
of irreducibles, a contradiction.

@ol
@li
Commutativity: $a + b = b + a$, $\forall a, b \in R$.
@li
Associativity: $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$.
@li
There is an element $0 \in R$ (called the @keyword{additive identity element} ),
such that $a + 0 = a$ for all $a \in R$.
@li
Every element of $R$ has an additive inverse; namely:
For all $a \in R$, there exists an element of $R$, usually denoted $-a$,
such that $a + (-a) = 0$.
@endol</li>
<li> Properties of $\times$:

@li
Associativity: $a(bc) = (ab)c$.

There is an element $1 \in R$ (called the @keyword{multiplicative identity element} ),

In a ring $R$, there is a unique additive identity element

@end
@proof
@newcol
Suppose there is an element $0' \in R$ such that $0' + r = r$ for all $r \in R$, then
in particular $0' + 0 = 0$.

@col
Since $0$ is an additive identity, we have $0' + 0 = 0'$.
So, $0' = 0$.

@col
Suppose there is an element $1' \in R$ such that $1'r = r$ or all $r \in R$,

@col
then in particular $1' \cdot 1 = 1$.

@col
But $1' \cdot 1 = 1'$ since $1$ is a multiplicative identity element, so $1' = 1$.
